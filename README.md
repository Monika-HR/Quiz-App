## 📋 Project Description

This Quiz App provides a seamless and intuitive quiz-taking experience. Before beginning the quiz, users are presented with an instruction page explaining all rules and expectations. Each question appears one at a time with a countdown timer, and users can select only one answer per question. Once selected, the answer is locked and the next question is automatically shown — either after the selection or when the timer runs out.

The application provides a summary page at the end of the quiz showing how many answers were correct or wrong, helping the user evaluate their performance.

This app is ideal for:
- Online assessments
- Practice tests
- Educational games
- Exam simulations
